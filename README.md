## PlanYourPlate - Meal Planning System
PlanYourPlate is a website optimized for a desktop environment designed to help users with planning their meals. Planning meals is something most individuals must do on a daily basis. Many individuals find this to be time consuming and mentally strenous leading these individuals to resort to the same recipes repeatedly. Many individuals also find it difficult to curate meals that fit their nutritional goals and incorporate the ingredients they already have on hand. Our application aims to make the process of finding recipes simple, relieving some of the strain this process causes. It will allow users to find recipes suited to their needs in a variety of ways. A user will be able to input ingredients they have available and it will suggest recipes curated based on those ingredients. A user can also receive suggested recipes based on their dietary preferences, allergies or desired amounts of macro-nutrients and calories. Furthermore, a user will be able to input foods they have already consumed and the website will provide nutritional information about those foods. Another element of this project is a calculator which will suggest the amount of calories and distribution of macro-nutrients one should consume based on their health and fitness goals.
